## About Pixelov
> **Pixelov** is a fan-made mobile idle game based off of the popular PC game, Escape from Tarkov. Pixelov takes place in post apocalyptic Russia in a region full of struggle and warfare. Scavengers roam the streets pillaging refugee camps and taking precious resources for themselves. You must set up your Hideout and successfully execute missions to gather resources to stay alive and defend yourself.

I have chosen to take on this project because I simply love Escape from tarkov. Playing that game felt like a horrible punishment, yet it provided hours of enjoyement for my friends and I. I wanted to take something from that and make something out of it that other EFT fans will appreciate. My main goal with Pixelov is to recreate a simplistic idle game version of EFT and do that while also learning Flutter!
