## About Pixelov
> **Pixelov** is a fan-made mobile idle game based off of the popular PC game, Escape from Tarkov. Pixelov takes place in post apocalyptic Russia in a region full of struggle and warfare. Scavengers roam the streets pillaging refugee camps and taking precious resources for themselves. You must set up your Hideout and successfully execute missions to gather resources to stay alive and defend yourself.

I have chosen to take on this project because I simply love Escape from tarkov. Playing that game felt like a horrible punishment, yet it provided hours of enjoyement for my friends and I. I wanted to take something from that and make something out of it that other EFT fans will appreciate. My main goal with Pixelov is to recreate a simplistic idle game version of EFT and do that while also learning Flutter!

## Development Blog

**04/02/2021**
> The core of the app (auth, db setup, user info) has been finished. I have created the Auth UI, Main Menu, Settings Pages. I have also implemented a Daily Reward system that relies on current local time to track whether the player is eligible for a daily reward

> I have just finished the initial implementation of the BadLands gamemode which is basically similar to a cookie clicker style game. I added a loot pool and random item drops from enemies killed. During this period of development, I have also taken care of some tedious null safety issues within the code base and overall tidied multiple things up. Some important features that have also been added include a full inventory system with persistence using a NoSQL db and complete with the games own database of items. Now that the game items are in the game and that we are basically done modeling the data, we can start working on the Hideout, Market, and actual game mechanics.
